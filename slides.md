# Immutable state

```ts
const gameState = {
  player: {
    name: "Aria",
    level: 5,
    inventory: [
      { id: 1, name: "Health Potion", quantity: 3 },
      { id: 2, name: "Sword", durability: 75 },
    ],
    stats: {
      health: 87,
      mana: 30,
      equipment: {
        weapon: "Iron Sword",
        armor: {
          head: "Leather Cap",
          body: "Iron Armor",
          legs: "Traveler's Pants",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  quests: [
    { id: 101, name: "Defeat the Goblin King", completed: false },
    { id: 102, name: "Collect 10 Herbs", completed: true },
  ],
};
